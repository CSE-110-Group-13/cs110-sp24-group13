- For homepage:
  - Recents should only show last 5 edited
  - Maybe remove favorites and don't make recents collapsable
- For linking a project/ linking notes:
  - When a project is linked in notes page that note should also be linked in the porjects page
  - Last worked on for project should update when a task is completed
