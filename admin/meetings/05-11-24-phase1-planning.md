# Pre-week 7 meeting

## Date and Location
5/11/2024, 4:00. Remote.
Meeting began: 4:04 pm
Meeting ended: 5:30 pm

## Attendees:
- Everyone except Salman and Jacqueline

## Agenda:
- Research technologies/techniques for pipelines
- Plan out pipeline and make requisite diagrams and whatnot

## Meeting Notes:
- For code styling: try to limit nesting. Easily readable variable names. Camel case.
- We'll be using one of the free style reviewers recommended by assignment.
- For testing: We'll be using Jest. We're not sure about puppeteer but we'll look into it. Its ok
- For documentation generation: there's a vscode extension called jsdoc that lets you make documentation automatically with a command. This goes through a command that we can run with github actions whenever we add a new code file.
- Defined pipeline in phase1.png
- Before coding, pull and then create new branch.
- When finished before the pull request run JSDocs and write + run local tests. Then JUnit tests + puppeteer after PR, then human code reviewers, then merge.
- Link your PR's to GitHub issues.
- Venkata already did ADR

## Action Items:
- Everyone gets JSDoc generator

- Addy and Maxime work towards electron implementation right after meeting

- We'll implement code climate asap

- UI/UX Team will go ahead first and then float teams will put together the skeleton. Backend team will look into implementing markdown.
