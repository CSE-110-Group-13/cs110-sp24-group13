## Agenda:
- Reflect on Sprint through a Miroboard
- Discuss what tasks to do next
- Discuss what were weaknesses and strengths and how to improve

## Meeting Notes:
- Created Miroboard for the four steps: Continue, Stop, Invent, Act
- Discussed what to do generally in the next sprint:
  - Communicate what tasks you're working on to the other teams
  - Set up unit testing and puppeteer testing
  - Pull request if the general functionality (skeleton) is completed, regardless of styling
  - Moving from teams taking on tasks to individuals taking on tasks (SOLOING)
- Create status update video for this week's sprint

[Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKOOTGvE=/?share_link_id=154817868365)

- Specific Tasks
  - Sarah & Venkata decide how to create the note component (that's used on the homepage, library, and favorites)

Float 1:
- Single Project View
- Edit Project
- Favorites Page

Float 2:
- Calendar
- View Note

UI/UX:
- Style the Multi Project View
- Create design for what to do when clicking add note and add project (e.g. on Project List page)

Backend:
- Update ProjectTable.js to include new parameters for dateCreated and tasksCompleted
- Complete TaskTable.js

## Key Take Aways of Retrospective:
- GitHub boards are a good way to keep organized for open and taken tasks
- Too much focus on styling took away time from creating the skeleton and core functionality
- More communication of when certain tasks are taken

## Additional topics discussed:
- Decided to pull request more often to have a more updated app for each branch
- Generate JSDocs
- Write unit tests and puppeteer
- Don't use shadow doms if unnecessary

# BIG GOAL FOR NEXT SPRINT (STARTING 5/26 till 06/09)
- Skeleton and core functionality to be done fully by June 2nd ~~(completion of second sprint)~~ **changed to June 9th for a 2 week sprint**
- Create tests and setup CI/CD
