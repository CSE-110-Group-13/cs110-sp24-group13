## Meeting Notes:
- For all points delivered during the pitch, see here.
- Feedback
	- suggests more features if possible - but final decision is up to the group
	- for user stories, it is preferred to have “As a … I want … so that …”
	- for the final presentation, it must be a PowerPoint/Slide presentation rather than a doc
	- the grading rubric for the project will emphasize on process and quality
- The project should be something we are proud of, not only as in coursework, but also as an achievement in our portfolio
- The limitation of this project is that we can only use HTML, CSS, and Javascript - limited libraries are allowed (such as the one for markdown rendering)
