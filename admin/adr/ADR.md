# Decisions: 


## **Have our files displayed in list view for the UI**

## Context

  We were unsure about how we should display our files in the UI.

## Considered Options

  We thought that either a list view or window view would be the best. 

## Desicion outcome

  We decided it was best to go with the list view since a majority of our files would be text files. Moreover, it is easier to implement and more efficient than a window view. 


## **Multiple pages for Calender** 

## Context 

  We didn't know how to display the calender. 

## Considered Options

  We thought that either having the calender in the main homepage or having it as a seperate page were good options. 

## Desicion outcome

  We decided it would be best to go with multiple pages because it would be harder to implement in HTML having everything in one page.
