# Dev Journal:

## How to Contribute: 
We'll add more here as we learn more about the technologies we'll need for the project, but this normally is just getting the right extensions, language support, and software downloaded.

## Issue Workflow

- Once you pick out an issue create a branch  
- Assign yourself and the others working on it on github boards, and then move it to _in progress_
- Create a task list of small steps in the process for tracking purposes. You do that by editing the issue on github boards
- Create a slack/discord channel for that issue if there's more than 1 assigned and get to work
- **Reach out got help** if you get stuck or too much gets on your plate. We can reassign your work or add more programmers

## You got this!!!!
