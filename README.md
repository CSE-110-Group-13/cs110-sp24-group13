# Dev Journal:

## Brief Description:  
This should be a full-stack web app to serve as a journal for a web developer. More information about the project will be written as more instructions are given.
Check out the project [here](https://cse-110-group-13.github.io/cse110-sp24-group13/source/homepage/index.html)

## Issue Workflow

- Once you pick out an issue create a branch  
- Assign yourself and the others working on it to the isssue on github boards, and then move it to _in progress_
- Create a task list of small steps in the process for tracking purposes. You do that by editing the issue on github boards
- Create a slack/discord channel for that issue if there's more than 1 assigned and get to work
- **Reach out for help** if you get stuck or too much gets on your plate. We can reassign your work or add more programmers
