# Group 13 - Good Draw
[About the team!](/admin/team.md)  

Our [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/odeiJOVBUigypF5W5i9X9C/Dev-Journal?node-id=112%3A82&t=OtFmd9BN0BnRaXgy-1) 

# Dev Journal:

## Brief Description:  
This should be a full-stack web app to serve as a journal for a web developer. More information about the project will be written as more instructions are given.

## Issue Workflow

- Once you pick out an issue create a branch  
- Assign yourself and the others working on it to the isssue on github boards, and then move it to _in progress_
- Create a task list of small steps in the process for tracking purposes. You do that by editing the issue on github boards
- Create a slack/discord channel for that issue if there's more than 1 assigned and get to work
- **Reach out for help** if you get stuck or too much gets on your plate. We can reassign your work or add more programmers
  
## How to Contribute: 
We'll add more here as we learn more about the technologies we'll need for the project, but this normally is just getting the right extensions, language support, and software downloaded.

## Keeping Your Fork Up to Date (I tried and this only works for forks, not branches)
You'll want to make sure you keep your fork up to date by tracking the original "upstream" repo that you forked. To do this, you'll need to add a remote:

```shell
# Add 'upstream' repo to list of remotes
git remote add upstream https://github.com/CSE-110-Group-13/cse110-sp24-group13.git
```

Whenever you want to update your fork with the latest upstream changes, you'll need to first fetch the upstream repo's branches and latest commits to bring them into your repository:
```shell
# Fetch from upstream remote
git fetch upstream
```


## You got this!!!!
## We got this!!!!
