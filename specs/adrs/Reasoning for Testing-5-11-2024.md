# Unit Testing 

# Status

Accepted

# Context

We looked at the different options for unit testing and researched the pros and cons for them. 

# Decisions 

- We decided to use Jest and Pupeteer for our testing because everyone is most comfortable with these from our labs.
- We also found that Jest is relatively a little simpler than the other the other unit testing frameworks.
- We decided that people who are working on the code should also write some basic tests before pull requesting. 
- Code reviewers will then add some more test cases later on. 

# Consequences

We now know how we should proceed going forward with test cases.
