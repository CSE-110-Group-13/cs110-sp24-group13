# Code Quality

# Status
Accepted

# Context
We looked at different options for code quality via a tool and researched the pros and cons for them.

# Decisions
- We decided to use Code Climate for our code quality because we can easily implement it in Github
- Code Climate provides automated code reviews, allowing us to identify issues such as duplication, rates maintainability, code complexity, etc.

# Consequences
Improves code quality and be more efficient on code reviews.
