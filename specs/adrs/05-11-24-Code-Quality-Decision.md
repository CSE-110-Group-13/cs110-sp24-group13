# Code Quality

# Status
Accepted

# Context
We looked at different options for code quality via a tool and researched the pros and cons for them.

# Decisions
- ~~We decided to use Code Climate for our code quality because we can easily implement it in Github~~
- ~~Code Climate provides automated code reviews, allowing us to identify issues such as duplication, rates maintainability, code complexity, etc.~~

**Update: 6/9/2024**

We decided to go with code styling guidelines in a [.md file](../../admin/cipipeline/phase1.md) instead. We did not use Code Climate.

# Consequences
Improves code quality and be more efficient on code reviews.
