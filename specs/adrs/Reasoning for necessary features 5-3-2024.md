# Necessary/Desired/Beyond features
## Context
Before we start, we need to figure out what features we want so we can prioritize properly
## Decisions
The following features were deemed necessary for the webapp's functionality:
1. Built in markdown editor
2. Ability to attach tags to journal entries
3. Ability to add priority to tasks, both by number and "high"/"low"/"mid"
4. Calendar with journal entries on it

The markdown editor will make the app easy to use and clean.

The tags and priority are necessary to make the entries sortable and searchable in convenient ways.

The calendar is also necessary for organizational use and planning. <br> <br>

The following features were deemed desirable. Things very good for functionality and feel but not strictly necessary.
1. Customizable journal entry template
2. Progress bar for tasks

The following features were deemed beyond. Not at all necessary to functionality, but would be nice to have.
1. Ability to search journals by keywords
2. Ability to pin journals at the top
3. Ability to categorize journal
4. Ability to have LaTeX formatting
5. Ability to set goals and mark as done
6. Git integration
7. Extension for search specific journals

## Consequences
We know the order we'll be implementing features in.
